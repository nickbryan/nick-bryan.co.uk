Hi, I'm Nick Bryan. I am a software developer, climbing enthusiast, musician and beer drinker. I currently work 
for [Mann Island Finance](https://www.mannisland.co.uk/), where I'm a full-time PHP developer building APIs and 
micro-services to facilitate our business domain. 

##A Brief History
I first got into programming when I was studying music production at university. I was curious as to how the software 
I was using was built and if I could build something similar myself. After making countless tutorial applications in 
C++ I took on my first big project, a real-time text based RPG in the terminal, lets just say this was not my 
finest work.

For my major project at university, I was required to set up a small business (an online record 
label). As a part of this I set up a website, which I built from scratch, using PHP to build a hacked up CMS. It was here 
where my passion for web development and software took off and I've been hooked ever since.

Although I do most of my development in PHP, I enjoy working with Javascript, C++ and exploring other languages and 
technologies in my spare time.

##Education
Being self taught, I have used a number of online resources to aid in my study and progression. I try to keep my skills 
up to date as much as possible and the following resources help me to do so.

###Treehouse
